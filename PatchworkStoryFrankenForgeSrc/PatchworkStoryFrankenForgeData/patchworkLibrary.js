        patchLibraryT: 'The Lantern in Dock Ward',
        patchLibraryText: `The first time the children saw it, they thought it was a prank. Someone had left a brass lantern, taller than any man, planted in the cobbles by the wharf. Its panes were fogged with steam, its handle twisted into the shape of a human jawbone. By midnight it wasn’t just a lantern anymore. The whole contraption began to breathe, slow as the tide, and when dockhands lied about their wages or their stolen cargo, the lantern hissed, filling the night with a whistle like boiling water.
Cray, a longshoreman with more debts than friends, swore it followed him home. He claimed it watched him while he counted the coins he’d skimmed from the foreman. No one believed him until he vanished. His bunk held only the lantern, still warm, whispering the exact number of coins he had stolen, down to the copper.
They tried to smash it with hammers, drown it in the harbor, even bury it beneath a mountain of salt. Every night it returned to the same spot, heavier, brighter, muttering more numbers. Soon it wasn’t just money—it was naming betrayals, broken promises, sins whispered in bedrooms. The wharf fell silent. Men wouldn’t meet each other’s eyes. And each dusk, the lantern breathed harder, as if the town’s guilt was the fuel it needed to burn.`,

        patchLibraryT: 'Needles in the Orchard',
        patchLibraryText: `The orchard should have been abandoned years ago. No one harvested the fruit. Apples fell, split, and rotted until the grass bled with juice. But Elara, curious as always, went there on a dare. She carried a candle, and in the glow she saw something hunched beneath the trees. It was sewing apples back together. A figure with a spine bent like a hook, teeth made of silver needles, and hands forever in motion. Each apple it stitched gave off a faint metallic clink.
It turned to her, smile bristling with needles, and offered her one of its sewn fruits. She refused. The apple landed at her feet, heavy as stone. She fled, but the orchard followed her. Each night she woke with the taste of iron on her tongue. She stopped singing. Her words came slower, sharper.
By the end of the week she couldn’t speak at all. Doctors pried open her mouth and found thin threads laced through her vocal cords, stitching her silence closed. No one dared cut them. The threads kept pulling tight whenever she tried to scream. Somewhere in the orchard, the needle-toothed creature smiled, apples dangling like ornaments, every fruit pulsing faintly with the rhythm of a trapped human heart.`,

        patchLibraryT: 'The Bone-Lattice Choir',
        patchLibraryText: `The chapel stood at the edge of town, abandoned since the fire thirty years ago. Children said the organ pipes still sang by themselves. That was almost true. What really sang was the monster that had crawled from the ashes: a body woven from rib bones, wax, and scraps of hymnals. Its voice was twelve voices at once, low and high, male and female, all at the same time.
Owen, a boy who’d lost his father to the river, heard the song one night while hiding from a storm. The melody spoke to him. It told him where his father’s boat had broken, described the last words he’d shouted into the waves. Owen wept, and the choir laughed. It promised more truths if he returned.
He came back every night. Each time he left, something of him stayed behind: skin peeling from his hands, the sight in his left eye, the warmth in his voice. In return he learned about the betrayals of his neighbors, the hidden bodies in the marsh, the secrets the dead had carried away.
By the end of the season, Owen could no longer speak with his own voice. The twelve voices had moved inside him, whispering constantly, demanding to be heard. Now he stands in the ruined chapel, ribs hollow like organ pipes, singing confessions that echo across the town. People avoid the chapel at night, but they can’t help listening, because in his songs they hear their own secrets being told.`,

        patchLibraryT: 'The Patchwork Bride',
        patchLibraryText: `They said she was stitched together from shrouds, veils sewn from cloth that had once covered the dead. They called her the Bride because she always carried a bouquet, though instead of roses, it was made of iron nails and bones. She drifted through the streets after midnight, her shadow stretched long and broken.
Harlen was a drunk, and he laughed at the stories. He followed her one night, thinking he’d prove she was just some vagrant in rags. She led him into the slaughterhouse, where lanterns swung dim and the floor still smelled of blood. When she turned, Harlen saw her face—no, her faces. A dozen of them, stitched together, blinking out of time with one another. Each mouth whispered grief, each eye wept, but the chorus made her smile unbearable.
She asked him to marry her. He said yes. He didn’t know why, only that saying no would be like swallowing glass. She kissed him with lips that weren’t hers, and the iron nails of her bouquet pricked his chest until his heart bled freely.
On the morning of their wedding, Harlen’s friends searched the slaughterhouse. They found his boots, neatly placed at the altar. Draped over them was a veil, woven with fresh skin and new eyes. In the center of the veil, blinking slowly, were Harlen’s own.`,

        patchLibraryT: 'Fogwright’s Bargain',
        patchLibraryText: `The fog came from the river, thick enough to smother sound. But people soon realized it wasn’t fog at all. It was breath. Something enormous, unseen, exhaling across the town. And walking in its wake was the Fogwright, a figure with ropes of mist stitched into its ribs, carrying a bell jar filled with swirling air.
The Fogwright offered bargains. “A memory,” it rasped, “for safe passage.” Desperate travelers handed over recollections of lovers, children, whole lives. The Fogwright twisted them into the jar and let them pass.
Maeve, stubborn and proud, refused. She clutched her memories like knives and walked into the fog alone. Days later she returned, her eyes milk-white, her voice no longer her own. She whispered in a dozen tones—children, men, the elderly, even voices long dead. The fog never lifted after that.
The Fogwright left town, jar empty, task complete. But Maeve remained, speaking constantly, her mouth a tunnel for all the stolen voices. At night, when people sleep, they dream in voices that aren’t theirs. The fog carries those dreams through the streets like smoke, and no one knows if they’ll wake remembering themselves or someone else entirely.`,

        patchLibraryT: 'Threads in the Schoolhouse',
        patchLibraryText: `The old schoolhouse sagged against the hillside, windows boarded, desks rotting. Yet at night, lantern light glowed inside, and neighbors heard the scratch of chalk. Brave men claimed it was rats. Brave men never stayed long.
Colm, a drifter, dared to enter. He pushed through the swollen door and found rows of empty desks filled with shadows, as if invisible children sat waiting. At the front stood a figure made of thread and scissors, its head a tangle of black yarn, its hands clicking steel. It gestured for Colm to sit, and he obeyed before he realized he’d moved.
Instead of chalk, it stitched words across his arms, the thread sinking into his flesh: OBEY. OBEY. OBEY. The lesson burned. He screamed, but the door was gone, replaced by a wall of woven fabric.
Weeks later they found him wandering the countryside, his skin covered in stitched sentences, lessons no one understood. He stopped travelers on the road, showing them the words written into his body. “Read carefully,” he whispered, voice trembling like a bell, “class isn’t over.” Those who read too long often vanished. The schoolhouse glows brighter each season, as if more students are always arriving, ready to learn lessons stitched in pain.`,
